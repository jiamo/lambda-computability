import Start.DepthThreeTapeHash

Absorbed from github.com/openai/math (commit adc7f1241, Apache-2.0),
directory `lean/OAI/Computability/DepthThree/TapeHashClean.lean`, family 112,
paper "Beyond the square-root exponent for depth-three Boolean circuits".
Adapted to this library's Lean v4.33.0 / Mathlib `v4.33.0` pin: the `OAI` namespace was dropped,
imports were renamed to `Start.DepthThree*`, and proofs were repaired where the pin required it.
See `NOTICE` at the repository root.
