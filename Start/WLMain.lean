Absorbed from github.com/openai/math (commit adc7f1241, Apache-2.0),
directory `lean/OAI/Computability/WeisfeilerLeman/Main.lean`, family 133,
paper not included in the snapshot (its README describes the result as
"n^Omega(k) lower bounds for k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman").
Adapted to this library's Lean v4.33.0 / Mathlib `v4.33.0` pin: the `OAI` namespace was dropped,
imports were renamed to `Start.WL*`, and proofs were repaired where the pin required it.
See `NOTICE` at the repository root.
